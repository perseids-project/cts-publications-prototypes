The text mapping is excellent, as well as the transcription and translation. A few notes:
-in the transcription, you are missing circumflex accents on "τõδε" and "χρυσõ". I realize that this seems to be an issue in Unicode, I will insert the accents myself.
-In the translation, I would recommend changing "is crowned" for "was crowned" to convey the aorist passive.
-I understand where you are coming from with "happened upon", but I think we can be a little less literal and go with something like "received" to convey the meaning of the sentence
-"crowned him" should be "crowned me"</change><change when="2013-12-10T19:32:46.596Z" who="http://data.perseus.org/sosol/users/Erin%20Cummins">Completed inscription for Archippos, submitted by Anastasia Trombly and Erin CumminsXML Markup Change
